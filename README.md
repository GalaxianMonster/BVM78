# BVM78
A low level virtual machine.
<br>
It does act like a real cpu but it has been made for educational or programming language purposes.
<br>
The architecture itself can be similar to x86, and more.

# Why?
I don't think this should be used at all.
<br>
The only purpose that I can think of is for adventure and learning purposes.
<br>
If you would like to use it on some project, you may.
