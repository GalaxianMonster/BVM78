-- BVM78 ARCHITECTURE STACK CFD0F6 --

----
Functionality:
  The BVM78 Stack functionality might be similar with x86
  When a value is pushed into the stack, the stack pointer decreases.
  When a value is popped from the stack, the stack pointer increases.
  
  Setup - 
    bp: 0x2,
    sp: 0x2,
    stack size: 2 bytes
  
  Push -
    val_width: byte,
    val: 0xfe,
    val_addr: 0x2,
    bp: 0x2,
    sp: 0x1,
    stack size: 1 byte
  
  Pop -
    val_width: byte,
    val_returned: 0xfe,
    bp: 0x2,
    sp: 0x2,
    stack size: 2 bytes
----

----
2 types of errors:
  - Stack overflow
      When the stack has no enough bytes to store the value during a. 
      push instruction, BVM78 halts and returns the error code to the
      software.
  - Stack underflow
      When the stack has no enough bytes stored in it during a pop
      instruction, BVM78 halts and returns the error code to the 
      software.
----

----
Initialization:
  bp: 0
  sp: 0
  
  Stack is not yet ready to have values be pushed or popped.
----

----
Deinitialization:
  BVM78 does nothing to the stack as it should be handled by the
  program that BVM78 is executing.
