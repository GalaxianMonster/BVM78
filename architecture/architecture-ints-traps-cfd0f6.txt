-- BVM78 ARCHITECTURE INTERRUPTS and TRAPS CFD0F6 --

----
Traps:
  They are used to be able to jump to the requested trap routine.
  
  Program being executed by BVM78 can set each trap routines address(which is basically add or remove trap routines).
  
  Opcodes that handles traps are:
    trap
    strp
    
  They will be explained in architecture-opcodes-cfd0f6.txt
----

----
Interrupts:
  They are used to invoke the program to do a interrupt routine.
  
  Unlike traps, program being executed by BVM78 are not able to set each interrupt routines.
  
  Opcode used to interrupt is: int.
